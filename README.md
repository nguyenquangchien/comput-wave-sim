# Computers, Waves, Simulations

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the Coursera online course "[Computers, Waves, Simulations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computers-waves-simulations)". 

The code and presentations are delivered by Prof Heiner Igel from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München ([LMU](https://www.lmu.de/en/), one of Europe's leading research universities.

You can also run all the Jupyter notebooks from [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/heinerigel/coursera/master). The preparation of the notebooks on mybinder may take up to a few minutes.
